## Introduction


The goal of this project is to build a robust malware detection system using machine learning and deep learning methodologies. In order to do this, we tranined three different models through a dataset containing excecutable file (both malign and benigns). After training the models to test the robustness we have implmented a GAMMA attack.

## Dataset Creation

Add link to dataset, describe how we created it and what's inside it.

## Models
Among the various methodologies in the literature we decide to implement two deep learning models and one of machine learning.

### MalConv

#### Network architecture

#### Feature extraction

#### Training and Validation phase

#### Test phase



### Image Based malware detector

#### Network architecture

#### Feature extraction

#### Training and Validation phase

#### Test phase


### Random forest

#### Network architecture

#### Feature extraction

#### Training and Validation phase

#### Test phase

### Results

## GAMMA

### Dataset Generation

### Evaluate generalization
