# Malware Detection System 
This repo contains code and report for the university exam Artificial intelligence for Cyber Security
The goal of this project is to build a robust malware detection system using machine learning and deep learning methodologies. More specifically, we used the following methodologies:
-  [MalConv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09435) (a neural network for malware detection from raw byte sequences)
-  Image Based malware detector (Transfer learning approach using ResNet50 as base model, pretrained with ImageNet weights, and we added a custom head fit for our purpose)
-  Random forest

In order to do this, we tranined these three different models through a dataset containing excecutable file (both malign and benigns). To test the robustness we have also implmented a **GAMMA** attack.
